# Week 2 

## Review
Last week, we set up Rstudio to use ssh keys and git. We cloned a shared github repository, edited, and pushed. 
We briefly talked about Markdown, and edited a python script.  Then we got stuck with a merge conflict!


## Git review
* Open Rstudio, switch to project carpen-group.
* Look at files in git pane - M = modified, A = added
* Click on "More" (gear icon), select "Shell".
* If you had trouble merging, use "git stash"

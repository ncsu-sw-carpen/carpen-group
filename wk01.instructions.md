# Week 1 - Getting started

For convenience, we'll be using Rstudio as an integrated text editor and git manager.  Rstudio was originally written for R, but can be used to edit code in any language.  In general, we'll be writing python code in files, and running those files from the terminal.  

First, we're going to customize Rstudio, and import the group github repo.

# Steps:

* Install Rstudio
* Rstudio Setup:
  * Tools -> Global Options ->  Git -> SSH RSA Key -> Create RSA Key
  * Tools -> Global Options ->  Git -> SSH RSA Key -> View Public Key (copy)
  * Paste public key into to github: https://github.com/settings/ssh
  * New project (top right) -> Version Control -> Git : Repository URL = https://github.com/ncsu-sw-carpen/carpen-group.git
  * Tools -> Global Options -> Code Editing -> Set Tab Width = 4
  * Tools -> Global Options -> Appearance -> Set Font = 16
  * Tools -> Global Options -> Appearance -> Set Theme = Solarized (Dark) 
* Open wk01.talkfun.py in Rstudio
* Run wk01.talkfun.py in Terminal
* Tour of Rstudio Git tools

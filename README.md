# NCSU Software Carpentry Group Repository
## About
NCSU Software Carpentry Group will meet Thursdays at 2pm to discuss software carpentry, including the use of python and sql (and possibly R).  Group meetings will be data-driven, and are appropriate for anyone who regularly uses computers to manipulate and analyze data.  8 (or more) weekly meetings are planned, beginning 2015-02-05, location TBD (Gardener Hall?).
Each meeting will be ~1.5 hours, and will include 20-30 minutes of prepared, guided material.  The remainder of the time is for group interaction and questions.

Weekly material will be stored in this repo.

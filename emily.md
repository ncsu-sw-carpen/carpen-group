#This is Emily's markdown file :-)
I am trying to catch up on things having missed two week.

I looked over the wk03.data.py script. I had to change the print statements because py3 requires parentheses.

Put my working python files in my folder Emily

The python debugger seems to work, but it complained about line 12. I moved it to just after the import so I could check everything. 
Debugger prints lines about lines 7, 48 and 67, then quits. Weird because there is no line 67 in the script!!!
